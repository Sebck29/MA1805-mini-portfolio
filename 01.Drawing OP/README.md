In the beginning of the production of my mini-portfolio, I orginally wanted to base my projects off of media I was was interested and intrigued by. However I wasn't sure how I would convey my inspiration over the course my four projects or if I could use media that wasnt free on sites such as pixabay. So I opted for simple projects that I knew I could complete. However I regret not taking more of a risk now.
